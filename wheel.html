				<p class="text-wheel">For developing this project, we started with desk-research about the current problems in the car industry. Then moved on to brainstorm phase, where the idea was refined. Our task was to conduct interviews and produce personas, scenarios to understand more if the product will be useful. Thereafter , I was responsible for SWOT competitive analysis to understand our brands potential. Once the main idea was clear, we moved onto design phase with sketches and wireframes.
